A decentralized cloud focused on speed, personal data ownership, and economic efficiency.

### How it works

- **Cloud Storage**: Users own nodes hosting personal data per-app
- **Edge Compute**: Apps store, get, and process data from the network
- **Reactors**: On-node reactions skip the edge, allowing real-time systems

These three layers are the core of Archeum, and should allow any kind of application to be built on top of it.

### Costs

- Archeum is and will always remain free for developers.
- Users pay Base L2 gas fees only once to register their handles (under $0.01 per handle).
- Users host their own node (hardware + electricity costs) or defer to a managed operator.

If you're an app developer, dive into the [Archeum SDK](https://github.com/archeum-dev/archeum-sdk) to get started!
