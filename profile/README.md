A decentralized cloud focused on speed, personal data ownership, and economic efficiency.

### How it works

- **Cloud Storage**: Users own nodes hosting personal data per-app
- **Edge Compute**: Apps store, get, and process data from the network
- **Reactors**: On-node reactions skip the edge, allowing real-time systems

These three layers are the core of Archeum, and should allow any kind of application to be built on top of it.

### Costs

- Archeum is and will always remain free for developers.
- Users register 1 handle for free, and then pay a fee on subsequent handles to support more free users.
- Users host their own node (hardware + electricity costs) or defer to a managed operator.

If you are:
- A user, install the [Archeum App](https://github.com/archeum-dev/archeum-app)
- An app developer, check out the [Examples](https://github.com/archeum-dev/examples)
- A contributor, dive into the [Archeum Node](https://github.com/archeum-dev/node), [Library](https://github.com/archeum-dev/lib), or [SDK](https://github.com/archeum-dev/sdk)
